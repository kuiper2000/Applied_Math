# Week 12:  Wave Equation  
Waves are ubiquitous and especially central to atmospheric sciences. Vibration on any material with restoring forces can generate waves. The existence of restoring force implies the existence of 2nd-order derivatives in time. One of the most well-known wave equation is Hooke's Law

\begin{align}
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx

where the restoring force is equivalent to how much the material is stretched except with an opposite sign. This suggesting the force is always going against to the stretched direction. It's not hard to find the solutions share a form
