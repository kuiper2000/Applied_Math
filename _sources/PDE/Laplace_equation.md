# Week 13:  Laplace Equation  
## Problem Setup and Initial Conditions
While Laplace equation is nothing new to readers since we have introduced two related special functions in the chapter of {ref}`SpecialF`, Legendre polynomial and Bessel function. While those special functions form a complete set of solution of diffusion equation for the corresponding coordinate, there is an alternative way of solving diffusion problem when certain boundary conditions are satisfied. (i.e., Sturm-Liouville theorem is satisfied). 


Let's begin with a diffusion problem on a Retangle (figure below),
