# Week 11:  Heat Equation  
Heat diffusion equation has important applications in engineering and Earth science. Especially when it comes to studying the Earth energy balance. In this chapter, we will consider a very simple 1D thermal diffusion problem. We will also demonstrate that we can always go to higher-dimension problem using _separation of variable_.
