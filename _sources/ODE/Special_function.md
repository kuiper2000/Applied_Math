# Week 9 and 10:  Special Functions 
## Special Functions, Series Solutions and Recurrence Relations


Following the discussion of Sturm-Liouville form in the last chapter, we will go a step further to check the cases of  $r(x)\neq 1$,  $q(x)\neq 0$, and $p(x)\neq 0$. Indicating that we have inhomogeneous grid spacing. Some cases such as cylindrical coordinate and spherical harmonics, their solutions
